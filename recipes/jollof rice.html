        <h3>Jollof a continental food served and eaten in all places.</h3>
        <p>
            A delicious sumptuous meal and yet can be very disappointing if cooking steps are not taken properly.

            In Ghana, in as much as it is eaten at home, it is regarded as an official meal thus mostly prepared on festive holidays and for the welcoming of guest.
            The day it is prepared at the home of some Ghanaian children is considered a very happy day for them.
